# Wine-Quality-Classification

This project compares the power of six different techniques - Logistic Regression (GLM),
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function
(SVM-RBF), Neural Networks (NNet), Neural Networks Average (AvgNN), and Random Forest
(RF) - to predict the quality of wine based solely on physicochemical properties.
